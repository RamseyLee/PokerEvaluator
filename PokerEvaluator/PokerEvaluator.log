2025-07-09 17:20:48,898 - INFO - Evaluation: Hey there! Let's take a look at your hand.

Holding Ace-King is a great start, and you played it aggressively, which is excellent. Making a "continuation bet" on this flop is the right idea. You have a fantastic draw with an open-ended straight draw and two overcards, so betting to build the pot and put pressure on your opponents is a solid, standard play.

The only thing to be mindful of is your early position. When you bet from this spot, it can sometimes signal a very strong hand to the players acting after you, which might make their decisions a little too easy.

For an improvement tip, consider sometimes using a smaller bet size, like one-third of the pot. This achieves a similar goal but risks less and does a better job of disguising your hand's true strength, making you a much tougher opponent to read.

Play responsibly within your limits.
